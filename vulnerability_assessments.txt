.gitignore: The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the following:
- SQL Injection: There are no queries to a database, so there is no risk of SQL injection.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS): The code does not handle user input or dynamically generate HTML, so there is no risk of XSS vulnerabilities.
- Cross
LICENSE: There is no code provided, hence no vulnerabilities can be assessed.
README.md: Potential vulnerabilities:

- Denial of service: The code does not implement any mechanism to prevent or mitigate denial of service attacks. As a result, an attacker could potentially overload the server by executing multiple instances of the scanning process, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.

- Insecure configuration: The code does not include
blackhole.py: The code does not contain any of the listed vulnerabilities.
blackhole.py: The code has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Denial of Service (DoS): The code can be vulnerable to DoS attacks due to the lack of rate limiting or request throttling mechanisms. An attacker can send a large number of requests to exhaust server resources and cause a denial of service.

2. Information Leakage:
blackhole.py: Vulnerabilities:
- Denial of service: The code does not have any rate limiting mechanism in place, which can lead to a denial of service attack by flooding the server with a large number of requests.
- Insecure configuration: The server sockets are created on random ports or from a user-provided list of ports. Random ports can potentially allow an attacker to guess an open port, while a user-provided list of ports may contain insecure or privileged ports.
- Insecure access control: The code does not perform any authentication or authorization checks before handling client requests. This can allow unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data.
- Insecure storage: The code loads files from the "responses" directory without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to directory traversal attacks or serve malicious files if the directory contents are controlled by an attacker.
